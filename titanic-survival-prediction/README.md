# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and family size.  
It is a **binary classification problem** and is commonly used as a beginner-level ML internship project.


## Objective
To build a predictive model that determines:
- **1 → Passenger Survived**
- **0 → Passenger Did Not Survive**


## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset  
- **Records:** 891 passengers


## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  


## Features Used
- Pclass (Ticket Class)  
- Sex  
- Age  
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)  
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)  
- Fare  
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)


## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Handling Missing Values  
4. Encoding Categorical Variables  
5. Train-Test Split  
6. Model Training  
7. Model Evaluation  


## Model Used
- **Logistic Regression**

**Why Logistic Regression?**
- Simple and interpretable  
- Suitable for binary classification  
- Good baseline model for beginners  


## Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** ~80%  

The model shows balanced precision and recall for both survival and non-survival classes, making it reliable for prediction.


## 📌 Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model successfully predicts Titanic passenger survival with approximately **80% accuracy**. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model evaluation, making it suitable for internship and academic submissions.
