# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It uses real-world transaction data to build and evaluate classification models for fraud detection.

##  Project Objectives
- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions
- Handle class imbalance in the dataset
- Train and compare machine learning models
- Evaluate performance using Precision, Recall, and F1-score

##  Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- The dataset is not uploaded to this repository due to GitHub file size limitations.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Kaggle Notebook

##  Algorithms Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

##  Methodology
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Feature scaling and normalization
3. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Performance evaluation

##  Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

##  Final Result
- Logistic Regression performed well with high fraud recall
- Random Forest showed a better balance between precision and recall
- Random Forest was selected as the final optimized model
